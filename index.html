			<i><h2><mark>Summary:</mark></h2></i>
			<p><mark>Castiel first appeared in Supernatural in Season 4 Episode 1: <i>Lazarus Rising</i>, played by Misha Collins. He is an angel of God, who had raised Dean Winchester from Hell. He is amongst a group of angels on Earth who aim to prevent the breaking of the 66 Seals that will release Lucifer and start the Apocalypse. He takes Jimmy as a vessel to keep his true form hidden, as seeing his true form typically results in a person's eyes being disintegrated and hearing his true voice pierces a human's ears. Time after time, he helped the Winchesters face many odds, whether it was monsters, demons, or even God himself. He starts out as an angel who expressed no emotion and followed orders without a doubt in his mind. After meeting Sam and Dean, however, he develops empathy and affection for humans.</mark></p>

			<i><h2><mark>Timeline of Castiel's Relationship with Dean:</mark></h2></i>
			<ul>
				<li><mark><b>Season 4: First Meeting & Rebellion</b> - Otherwise known as the very first season in which Castiel premieres. Castiel pulls Dean out of Hell in his first episode and is revealed to be an angel of the Lord. He and Dean didn't necessarily like each other since Dean saw Castiel as an objective and shrewd angel who doesn't care about humans and Castiel saw Dean as a human who should be grateful to him for pulling him out of Hell. As the season progresses, Castiel's doubts grew, resulting in him rebelling against Heaven for Dean, marking the beginning of their long-lasting relationship.</mark></li>
				<li><mark><b>Season 5: Becoming Friends & the Apocalypse Begins</b> - Castiel starts hanging around the Winchesters more often after rebelling Heaven because he believes in their cause. Since the brothers had a sort of falling out in Season 4 (due to Sam continuing his obsession with demon blood and accidentally starting the apocalypse), Dean spends more time with Castiel. By the end of the season, they become great friends and grow closer.</mark></li>
				<li><mark><b>Season 6: Blind Trust & Betrayal</b> - Castiel raises Sam from Lucifer's Cage, but was only able to get his physical body out, leaving his soul in the Cage. The brothers are brought back together and begin saving people, hunting things, and continuing the family business. Sam and Bobby start to suspect Cas of having ulterior motives, but Dean still shows blind trust towards him. When Cas' betrayal becomes clear, their relationship is interrupted.</mark></li>
				<li><mark><b>Season 7: Time Apart & Rise of the Leviathans</b> - With the Leviathans taking full control of Castiel, he is seen exploding in the lake and thought to be dead. Throughout the season, Dean's mental state declines drastically partially due to what had happened to Cas. However, he comes back with his memories wiped and Dean returns his trenchcoat that he had been carrying with him since he had lost Castiel. They, soon, defeat the Leviathans and, as a result, Cas and Dean are sent to Purgatory.</mark></li>
				<li><mark><b>Season 8: Purgatory & Mind Control</b> - Castiel and Dean remained in Purgatory for a year, during which they fought monsters and Dean met a friendly vampire by the name of Benny. Dean does everything he can to get Cas out of there, but when he doesn't come back out of his own will, Dean blames himself. When Castiel returns, he is under Naomi's control who pushes him to try and kill Dean. Castiel breaks away at the very last moment, proving his bond with Dean was much stronger than mind control.</mark></li>
				<li><mark><b>Season 9: Human Cas & Defeating Metatron</b> - After his grace was taken as the final part of Metatron's spell, Castiel becomes human and is left alone to fend for himself since Sam's life was in danger. However, Dean still checks up on Cas and helps him with a date (Later, it was found out he was there to babysit, not go on a date). By the end of the season, Castiel has to choose between Heaven and Dean. In the end, to no surprise, he chooses Dean once again.</mark></li>
				<li><mark><b>Season 10: Mark of Cain & Cas Bonds with Sam</b> - Sam and Cas begin working together to save Dean. Cas becomes more like a human as the season progresses, but Dean starts losing his humanity due to the Mark of Cain corrupting him. By the end of the season, Castiel tries to stop Dean, but Dean beats him and tries to kill him due to the Mark's effect. Even though he was overtaken by the Mark, he couldn't kill Cas, proving again their relationship was much stronger than a curse.</mark></li>
				<li><mark><b>Season 11: Casifer & Amara</b> - To save the world and the Winchesters, Castiel sacrifices himself by saying yes to being possessed by Lucifer in the hopes of Lucifer defeating Amara. Throughout the season, Castiel is possessed by Lucifer until episode 23, in which Dean checks on Lucifer after the fight with Amara and finds out Lucifer is gone. In order to get rid of Amara, Dean chooses to willingly sacrifice himself for his family.</mark></li>
				<li><mark><b>Season 12: Family & Death</b> - Castiel attempts to make amends for the events of Season 11 by doing what he can to save the Winchesters. The season follows the theme of family and how Cas has become a part of the Winchesters' clan. Dean attempts to show Cas that he wants him to be alive and with him, even though Castiel is not as powerful as he used to be. The season starts with Cas and Dean hugging each other after finding out Dean is alive, but ends with Dean seeing Castiel being killed in front of him.</mark></li>
				<li><mark><b>Season 13: Grief & Subsequent Reunion</b> - Dean deals with the grief of losing Cas and becomes hopeless and devastated until Castiel is, once again, revived. Dean is happy to have Cas back and they both dress up as cowboys and talk about watching movies together in the <i>"Tombstone"</i> episode. The season progresses with the Winchesters warming up to a new member of their tribe, Jack.</mark></li>
				<li><mark><b>Season 14: Fatherhood & Breaking Relationships</b> - Jack, Castiel's adopted son, officially becomes a part of the team. Cas deals with fatherhood and tries to be a good role model for Jack. However, Jack accidentally kills Mary Winchester, the Winchester brothers' resurrected mom, and Dean puts the blame on Cas. Their relationship becomes strained, especially when Dean traps Jack in the Ma'lak Box. Castiel stands up for his son, but to no avail. Dean and Cas are at odds with each other due to Jack, espcially when Dean attempts to kill Jack with a special gun that can kill anything, but kills the user as well.</mark></li>
				<li><mark><b>Season 15: Love Confession & the Finale</b> - The tension is at its highest peak due to the Apocalypse, once again, starting thanks to Chuck this time. Dean ignores Castiel, even though they are trying to defeat God. Amends are made when Cas' life is in danger in Purgatory. Dean shows how sorry he is for pushing Cas away and how much he needs him. The season centers around their relationship, coming to a climax when Castiel declares his love right before sacrificing his life for Dean by taking Death with him to the Empty, the place where angels and demons go when they die. Castiel is not seen much at all afterwards, but he is said to have gotten out of the Empty and now works to help Jack make Heaven a better place.</mark></li>
