			<i><h2><mark>Summary:</mark></h2></i>
			<p><mark>Castiel first appeared in Supernatural in Season 4 Episode 1: Lazarus Rising, played by Misha Collins. He is an angel of God, who had raised Dean Winchester from Hell. He is amongst a group of angels on Earth who aim to prevent the breaking of the 66 Seals that will release Lucifer and start the Apocalypse. He takes Jimmy as a vessel to keep his true form hidden, as seeing his true form typically results in a person's eyes being disintegrated and hearing his true voice pierces a human's ears. Time after time, he helped the Winchesters face many odds, whether it was monsters, demons, or even God himself. He starts out as an angel who expressed no emotion and followed orders without a doubt in his mind. After meeting Sam and Dean, however, he develops empathy and affection for humans.</mark></p>
